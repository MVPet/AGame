{"name":"Fighting Game","tagline":"A fighting game using SFML","body":"### Welcome to the page for Fighting Game.\r\nThis is a project that was recently started as a break from Unity and C#.\r\nIt is a game that is made with C++ and the SFML API.\r\n\r\nThe game has gone through a few different concepts, such as a Beat 'em Up, but it is settled that it will be a fighting game to test out some concepts which will then be used in a Beat 'em Up later.\r\n\r\nCurrent plans are for just one fighter to test out concepts, and gameplay mechanics are not quite set in stone, but there is a plan for them.\r\n\r\nCurrently not in a playable state and is still being developed.\r\n\r\n### Updates:\r\n```\r\n\r\nJune 19, 2014\r\n- Added in Stages (City.cpp, RoofNight.cpp, School.cpp)\r\n- Cleaned up and organized unnecessary code\r\n- Added comments to many of the cpp files\r\n\r\nJune 14, 2014\r\n- Added in animations and basic code for attacks\r\n- Attacks include Light, Medium, and Heavy as well as versions while\r\ncrouching\r\n- Added in 4 rectangles in Animation.cpp, which will be used for\r\ncollision boxes.\r\n- Fixed bug where animations would loop no matter what\r\n- Minor optimization done\r\n\r\nJune 13, 2014\r\n- Fixed Animation.cpp to work with multiframe animations\r\n- Added in AnimationHolder.cpp and AnimationHolder.h which is used to\r\nhold all the animations for an object\r\n- Added in code for \"flipping\" the fighters\r\n- Added in Stand, Walk, BackWalk, and Crouch animations for Yu. Need to\r\nbe redone however, as all sprites in sheet are not same size.\r\n- Basic movement coded in for Yu (Walking, Crouching)\r\n\r\nJune 10, 2014\r\n- E3, so not much is getting done until around Wednesday/Thursday\r\n- Added in Animation class to handle Sprite sheet animations\r\n     - probably works, only tested with one frame animations\r\n- Created classes for specific fighters (Polymorphism, ho!), for more specific \r\n  code that a character might need.\r\n- Altered some other classes as some of the code didn't quite work with \r\n  the new classes.\r\n\r\nJune 3, 2014\r\n- Added in some new classes\r\n     - Game.cpp, a rewrite of manager class\r\n     - TexureManager.cpp, used for objects to store their used textures\r\n     - Fighter.cpp, base class for the fighters, not complete yet\r\n- Updated main.cpp to use less code, moved most of it to Game.cpp\r\n- Kept older classes and unused classes, will be cleansed out later.\r\n- Basic graphics drawing available, test stand sprite included to test it.\r\n\r\nMay 22, 2014\r\n- Added in Animation class\r\n- Added in fixed update timestep of ~60fps\r\n\r\nApril 24, 2014\r\nFirst Commit\r\n- Set up the game manager class with default functions and such\r\n- Got SFML working with the project\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Back to Main Page](http://mvpet.github.io/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
