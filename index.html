<a name="welcome-to-the-page-for-fighting-game" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-the-page-for-fighting-game"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the page for Fighting Game.</h3>

<p>This is a project that was recently started as a break from Unity and C#.
It is a game that is made with C++ and the SFML API.</p>

<p>The game has gone through a few different concepts, such as a Beat 'em Up, but it is settled that it will be a fighting game to test out some concepts which will then be used in a Beat 'em Up later.</p>

<p>Current plans are for just one fighter to test out concepts, and gameplay mechanics are not quite set in stone, but there is a plan for them.</p>

<p>Currently not in a playable state and is still being developed.</p>

<h3>
<a name="updates" class="anchor" href="#updates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Updates:</h3>

<pre><code>June 14, 2014
- Added in animations and basic code for attacks
- Attacks include Light, Medium, and Heavy as well as versions while
crouching
- Added in 4 rectangles in Animation.cpp, which will be used for
collision boxes.
- Fixed bug where animations would loop no matter what
- Minor optimization done

June 13, 2014
- Fixed Animation.cpp to work with multiframe animations
- Added in AnimationHolder.cpp and AnimationHolder.h which is used to
hold all the animations for an object
- Added in code for "flipping" the fighters
- Added in Stand, Walk, BackWalk, and Crouch animations for Yu. Need to
be redone however, as all sprites in sheet are not same size.
- Basic movement coded in for Yu (Walking, Crouching)

June 10, 2014
- E3, so not much is getting done until around Wednesday/Thursday
- Added in Animation class to handle Sprite sheet animations
     - probably works, only tested with one frame animations
- Created classes for specific fighters (Polymorphism, ho!), for more specific 
  code that a character might need.
- Altered some other classes as some of the code didn't quite work with 
  the new classes.

June 3, 2014
- Added in some new classes
     - Game.cpp, a rewrite of manager class
     - TexureManager.cpp, used for objects to store their used textures
     - Fighter.cpp, base class for the fighters, not complete yet
- Updated main.cpp to use less code, moved most of it to Game.cpp
- Kept older classes and unused classes, will be cleansed out later.
- Basic graphics drawing available, test stand sprite included to test it.

May 22, 2014
- Added in Animation class
- Added in fixed update timestep of ~60fps

April 24, 2014
